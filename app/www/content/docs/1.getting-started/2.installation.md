## Quick Start

The easiest way to use `sse-hooks` is via our CLI tool. This allows you to interactively manage hooks and add only what you need to your project.

You can initialize the tool with:

```bash [Terminal]
npx sse-tool init
```

Once initialized, you can manage your hooks using the following commands:

1. **List available hooks** to see what you can install:
   ```bash
   npx sse-tool list
   ```

2. **Add a specific hook** directly to your project:
   ```bash
   npx sse-tool add <hook-name>
   ```

That's it! The hook will be added to your project structure automatically 🚀

  npm install sse-hooks
  ```
  ```bash [yarn]
  yarn add sse-hooks
  ```
  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm add sse-hooks
