## Quick Start

The easiest way to use `sse-hooks` is via our CLI tool. This allows you to interactively manage hooks and add only what you need to your project.

You can initialize the tool with:

::code-group{sync="pm"}
  ```bash [npm]
  npx sse-hooks init
  ```
  ```bash [yarn]
  yarn dlx sse-hooks init
  ```
  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm dlx sse-hooks init
  ```
  ```bash [deno]
  deno run -A npm:sse-hooks init
  ```
  ```bash [bun]
  bunx sse-hooks init
  ```
::

Once initialized, you can manage your hooks using the following commands:

1. **List available hooks** to see what you can install:

   ::code-group{sync="pm"}
    ```bash [npm]
    npx sse-hooks list
    ```
    ```bash [yarn]
    yarn dlx sse-hooks list
    ```
    ```bash [pnpm]
    pnpm dlx sse-hooks list
    ```
    ```bash [deno]
    deno run -A npm:sse-hooks list
    ```
    ```bash [bun]
    bunx sse-hooks list
    ```
   ::

2. **Add a specific hook** directly to your project:

   ::code-group{sync="pm"}
    ```bash [npm]
    npx sse-hooks add <hook-name>
    ```
    ```bash [yarn]
    yarn dlx sse-hooks add <hook-name>
    ```
    ```bash [pnpm]
    pnpm dlx sse-hooks add <hook-name>
    ```
    ```bash [deno]
    deno run -A npm:sse-hooks add <hook-name>
    ```
    ```bash [bun]
    bunx sse-hooks add <hook-name>
    ```
   ::

That's it! The hook will be added to your project structure automatically 🚀
